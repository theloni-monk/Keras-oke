00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.720


2
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:21.640
There must be some way out of here," said the joker to the thief,

3
00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:30.640
"There's too much confusion, I can't get no relief

4
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:38.320
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth

5
00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:44.240
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth."

6
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.240


7
00:00:44.240 --> 00:01:06.440
"No reason to get excited", the thief, he kindly spoke,

8
00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:13.680
"There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke

9
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:22.720
But you and I, we've been through that, and this is not our fate

10
00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:44.760
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late".

11
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.760


12
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:50.760
All along the watchtower, princes kept the view

13
00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:58.160
While all the women came and went, barefoot servants, too.

14
00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.760


15
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:05.880
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl

16
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:31.280
Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl.
